# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

## Description
This project demonstrates the differences between arrays and ArrayLists in Java by allowing user interaction. It showcases how to declare and use arrays and ArrayLists, including how to handle user input and dynamically resize an ArrayList.

## Array Example
 - Declares an array of fixed size 5.
 - Prompts the user to input integer values for each element in the array.
 - Handles invalid input using a try-catch block.
 - Prints the elements of the array.

## ArrayList Example
 - Declares an ArrayList.
 - Prompts the user to input integer values to add to the ArrayList until the user types 'done'.
 - Handles invalid input using a try-catch block.
 - Demonstrates the dynamic resizing capability of ArrayList by allowing the user to add more elements.
 - Prints the elements of the ArrayList.

## Code Interaction
 - For the array example, you will be prompted to enter five integers.
 - For the ArrayList example, you can continuously add integers by typing them in. Type 'done' to finish adding elements.
 - After the initial input, you will be prompted again to add more integers to demonstrate the dynamic resizing of the     
   ArrayList. Type 'done' to finish.
